## Presentation

### Renderer, editor and category on calculated properties

Previously, the [calculated properties specification](../presentation/content/CalculatedPropertiesSpecification.md) only allowed specifying property [label](../presentation/content/CalculatedPropertiesSpecification.md#attribute-label) and [value](../presentation/content/CalculatedPropertiesSpecification.md#attribute-value). Now the specification has an ability to assign [renderer](../presentation/content/CalculatedPropertiesSpecification.md#attribute-renderer), [editor](../presentation/content/CalculatedPropertiesSpecification.md#attribute-editor) and [category](../presentation/content/CalculatedPropertiesSpecification.md#attribute-categoryid) to calculated properties.
